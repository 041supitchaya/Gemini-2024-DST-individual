### Normal Flow of Events
| Step | Description |
|---|---|
| 1 | The astronomer selects "Create Science Plan" from the menu.  |
| 2 | The system displays a form for entering details (e.g., target object, observation time, telescope settings) |
| 3 | Before saving, the astronomer can preview or simulate the plan using a virtual telescope to test how it would function under different conditions (e.g., weather, instrument availability).  |
| 4 | The astronomer fills in the details and optionally attaches comments, notes, or reference materials for the Science Observer. |
| 5 | The astronomer clicks "Save", and the system validates the entered data.  |
| 6 | The system saves the plan to the database and confirms successful creation. |
| 7 | The system tracks the version of the plan for accountability and allows rollbacks if modified later. |
| 8 | The astronomer has the option to submit the science plan for validation immediately after creation. |

### Subflows
| Step | Condition |
|---|---|
| **5a** | The system verifies that all required fields are filled and correct. |
| **5a** | If data is incomplete, the system prompts the astronomer to correct the errors. |

### Alternate/Exceptional Flow
| Step | Condition |
|---|---|
| **3a** | The system notifies the user that the simulation service is temporarily unavailable. |
| **3a** | The astronomer can proceed without simulation.  |
| **5b** | The system notifies the user of an error and suggests retrying later.  |
